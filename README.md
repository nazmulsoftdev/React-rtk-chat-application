This is a chat application for multiplate users. You may wonder or feel like that; oh, it's a common application as usual, like made people from YouTube. No, it's a wrong thought. It's a React application, but I did explore how to structure complex applications and complex state management in an application. I used enough of the power of my React and Redux knowledge in this application. If you want to test this application, open two browsers and create a new account in two browsers, then send a message by modal, and then explore how it's amazing.
